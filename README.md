## When a Grammar is given as input, write a program to find out the following: Total Number of Productions in that grammar, Total Number of variables in that grammar, Total Number of terminals in that grammar.


Initially, we are given the productions of the grammar and asked to find out the total number of terminals, productions and variables.
Step1:Read the productions into a 2D Character Array
Step2:Identify all the Variables as uppercase letters.
Step3:Identify the rest as Terminals excluding the ‘->’ and ‘|’ symbol.
Step4:Find out the number of productions
Step5:Identify the common symbols in both terminals and variables
Step6:Find out the count of each and print them.
